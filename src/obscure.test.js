I have a further armor-related question
if you give your guy armor with Aged Sensei, and then attack with it and the opponent's tower pings the armor
off, and /then/ you cast Art of War and gain two more armor, do you still lose one immediately at the end of your
turn?

yep */

/* you have 1 gold, a gilded glaxx with a lethal amount of -1 runes being kept alive by its ability, a  flying unit
with 1 hp, and a wandering mimic.

they have maxband orpal on patrol and setsuki in backline. you declare that you're attacking setsuki with the flying
mimic, so you pay your last gold. glaxx dies, -1 rune from orpal's maxband spreads to the 1hp flier, killing it.
wandering mimic loses flying and is now "illegally" attacking setsuki past the patrolling orpal
